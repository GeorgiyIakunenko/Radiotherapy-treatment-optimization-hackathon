Introduction to the challenge
Create an application which helps doctors with optimization of Radiation Therapy Treatments - even distribution of the linear accelerator's load. Physician relief with a modern, streamlined UI, UX appointment system.
Selection  of  linear  accelerators:  depends  on  the  organs  to  be  irradiated,  patient's weight, and the number of fractions
Treatment duration can be 10-15-20-30 minutes.
Other tasks, considerations
Patient notifications - push, email, SMS
Inpatient bed reservation – with bath, male/female rooms, possibly a floor plan, 10% of beds required
Patient transport depending on the patient's condition, including stairs, wheelchair, nearby treatment room
Handling cancellations, filling empty slots
Machine maintenance - 50% should be managed by patients on other machines Machine breakdowns - repairs typically occur within 4 hours, inpatient and high- priority patient treatments cannot be delayed
UI UX - User Interface and Experience Design
Transparent, simple, easy to use
Where the patient's treatment stands
Drag and drop functionality
Machine workload statistics on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.
5 linear accelerators / irradiation devices
1-2. TrueBeam: capable of all treatments
3-4. VitalBeam: 85% capacity compared to TrueBeams. Not suitable for large-bodied patients and breath-holding.
5. Unique – Clinac 1 energy: Simplest machine, low fractionation and lack of kV imaging

Who we are
At Varian, a Siemens Healthineers company, we envision a world without fear of cancer. For more than 70 years, we have developed, built and delivered innovative cancer care technologies and solutions for our clinical partners around the globe to help them treat millions of patients each year. With an Intelligent Cancer Care approach, we are harnessing advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to enhance cancer treatment and expand access to care. Our 10,000 employees across 70 locations keep the patient and our clinical partners at the center of our thinking as we power new victories in cancer care. Because, for cancer patients everywhere, their fight is our fight. For more information, visit http://www.varian.com.
What we will provide
Competitors will be supported by various software developers and product managers from the medical domain, moreover we invite a physicist from the National Institute of Oncology to answer healthcare related questions.
Implementation and technology
There is no "technical" limitation, you can choose whatever languages / platforms / tooling you want to use.
Judging criteria
For the evaluation process we will use the following matrix:



// Text 


We provide the algorithm which can find the sequence of the best time slots for the patient.
The result of this algorithm is also easily adjustable by the doctor in case if it is needed.

Web interface is easy to use by the doctors and it is provide very convenient way
to manage the patients, track their situations and change fields if it is needed. 




We optimize and simplify hard and time-consuming task to find the right time slots for a patients.

To use our app you need to login as a doctor.
After that you can add a new patient with the information about him.
You can adjust patient data any time if it is needed.

To schedule an appointment sequence for a patient we provide an efficient algorithm
which analyze the machine load and a patient data to find the best time slots.

The result of this algorithm is easily adjustable by the doctor in case if it is needed.

We also provide a handy scheduler interface which is easy to use and convenient to manage the patients.



// final version

We make complex tasks easier by simplifying the process of finding the right time slots for patients.
By optimizing the load we can focus on saving lives.

To use our app, simply log in as a doctor.
From there, you can easily add new patients with specific details and adjust their information whenever necessary.

For scheduling appointments, we've implemented an efficient algorithm. 
It analyzes both machine load and patient data to pinpoint the best time slots. 
If needed, doctors can easily adjust the results of this algorithm.

Our app also comes with a user-friendly interface.
It's easy to use and makes patient management a breeze.
